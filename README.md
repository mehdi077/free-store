my name is mehdi, and this is a next js 15 app, wich is intended to be a full e commerce platform, that has admin panel and product page, this is simple but covers all ones need to run an e commerce business FOR FREE.

the idea was to be able to have an e commerce website for free, levreging the vercel hobby plan, wich lets users deploy next js code and host it for free, and also a using the always free plan of the BAAS used in this project, wich is convex.

setting up this web app is simple and stright forward:

1 - for this repo into you rithub account.
2 - create a vercel account, and connect your account with your github account.
3 - create a convex account (regestration in this BAAS is only via github).
4 - create a new project in vercel and choose the forked repo of this project.
5 - turn on "build command" in the build settings, and use this command in it `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`
6 - turn on the "install command" and use in it this `npm install`
